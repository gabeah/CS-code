README for HW6: Trees, trees everywhere!

Created by: Gabe H and Julia O

Thanks to tutors Callie and Becca :)

The following code is to manipulate trees.

Our design logic was at first to use loops, but then recursivity decided that our lives would
be much simpler if we just did recursion.

How to build: We tried using Make, but after strange errors that had even the tutors confused,
we resorted to using regular ol' g++ and flags.

This was the command we used to compile our code:
g++ -g -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c++17 -O3 -o tree test_tree.cc tree.cc
