CSCI 221 - HW8
By: Yik Yin Cheuk

This homework is pain. 

forest.hh/.cc and htree.hh/.cc:
These files were provided by Eitan and no changes were made. 

huffman.hh:
Defines the huffman class. 
Private method createTree builds the huffman tree, and the other two private members stores the frequency table and the huffman tree for encode and decode.

huffman.cc:
The constructor uses the assign function to set the initial frequency of every character to 0. 
The encode method relies on the possible_path_to method from the Tree class. Then, I converted the vector of Direction to a vector of bool.
The decode method traverses the tree to locate the symbol that it represents. 
The buildTree method is basically the "main" of the class. I haven't fully debugged this method, due to some technical errors that I (along with other people) were not able to figure out.
